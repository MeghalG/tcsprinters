They do this by engaging in an\ninteractive protocol to jointly compute $f(x,y)$. The goal is to do this in an\nerror-resilient way, such that even given some fraction of adversarial\ncorruptions to the protocol, both parties still learn $f(x,y)$.\n  Typically, the error resilient protocols constructed by interactive coding\nschemes are \\emph{non-adaptive}, that is, the length of the protocol as well as\nthe speaker in each round is fixed beforehand. The maximal error resilience\nobtainable by non-adaptive schemes is now well understood. In order to\ncircumvent known barriers and achieve higher error resilience, the work of\nAgrawal, Gelles, and Sahai (ISIT 2016) introduced to interactive coding the\nnotion of \\emph{adaptive} schemes, where the length of the protocol or the\nspeaker order are no longer necessarily fixed.\n  In this paper, we study the power of \\emph{adaptive termination} in the\ncontext of the error resilience of interactive coding schemes. In other words,\nwhat is the power of schemes where Alice and Bob are allowed to disengage from\nthe protocol early? We study this question in two contexts, both for the task\nof \\emph{message exchange}, where the goal is to learn the other party's input.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Meghal Gupta</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Rachel Yun Zhang</name>\n    </author>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04586v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04586v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.DS\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.DS\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"math.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02496v1</id>\n    <updated>2018-10-05T02:39:43Z</updated>\n    <published>2018-10-05T02:39:43Z</published>\n    <title>Hands-Free One-Time and Continuous Authentication Using Glass Wearable\n  Devices</title>\n    <summary>  Users with limited use of their hands, such as people suffering from\ndisabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH), face challenges when\nauthenticating with computer terminals, specially with publicly accessible\nterminals such as ATMs. A new glass wearable device was recently introduced by\nGoogle and it was immediately welcomed by groups of users, such as the ones\ndescribed above, as Google Glass allows them to perform actions, like taking a\nphoto, using only verbal commands. This paper investigates whether glass\nwearable devices can be used to authenticate users, both to grant access\n(one-time) and to maintain access (continuous), in similar hands-free fashion.\nWe do so by designing and implementing Gauth, a system that enables users to\nauthenticate with a service simply by issuing a voice command, while facing the\ncomputer terminal they are going to use to access the service. To achieve this\ngoal, we create a physical communication channel from the terminal to the\ndevice using machine readable visual codes, like QR codes, and utilize the\ndevice's network adapter to communicate directly with a service. More\nimportantly, we continuously authenticate the user accessing the terminal,\nexploiting the fact that a user operating a terminal is most likely facing it\nmost of the time. We periodically issue authentication challenges, which are\ndisplayed as a QR code on the terminal, that cause the glass device to\nre-authenticate the user with an appropriate response. We evaluate our system\nto determine the technical limits of our approach.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Dimitrios Damopoulos</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Georgios Portokalidis</name>\n    </author>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02496v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02496v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.CR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.CR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.HC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.8022v3</id>\n    <updated>2014-12-15T09:33:32Z</updated>\n    <published>2014-07-30T12:41:21Z</published>\n    <title>The Gaussian Channel with Noisy Feedback: Near-Capacity Performance via\n  Simple Interaction</title>\n    <summary>  Consider a pair of terminals connected by two independent additive white\nGaussian noise channels, and limited by individual power constraints. The first\nterminal would like to reliably send information to the second terminal, within\na given error probability. We construct an explicit interactive scheme\nconsisting of only (non-linear) scalar operations, by endowing the\nSchalkwijk-Kailath noiseless feedback scheme with modulo arithmetic. Our scheme\nachieves a communication rate close to the Shannon limit, in a small number of\nrounds. For example, for an error probability of $10^{-6}$, if the Signal to\nNoise Ratio ($\\mathrm{SNR}$) of the feedback channel exceeds the $\\mathrm{SNR}$\nof the forward channel by $20\\mathrm{dB}$, our scheme operates $0.8\\mathrm{dB}$\nfrom the Shannon limit with only $19$ rounds of interaction. In comparison,\nattaining the same performance using state of the art Forward Error Correction\n(FEC) codes requires two orders of magnitude increase in delay and complexity.\nOn the other extreme, a minimal delay uncoded system with the same error\nprobability is bounded away by $9\\mathrm{dB}$ from the Shannon limit.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Assaf Ben-Yishai</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Ofer Shayevitz</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing, October\n  2014</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.8022v3\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.8022v3\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"math.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13994v1</id>\n    <updated>2025-04-18T17:28:40Z</updated>\n    <published>2025-04-18T17:28:40Z</published>\n    <title>Terminal Lucidity: Envisioning the Future of the Terminal</title>\n    <summary>  The Unix terminal, or just simply, the terminal, can be found being applied\nin almost every facet of computing. It is available across all major platforms\nand often integrated into other applications. Due to its ubiquity, even\nmarginal improvements to the terminal have the potential to make massive\nimprovements to productivity on a global scale. We believe that evolutionary\nimprovements to the terminal, in its current incarnation as windowed terminal\nemulator, are possible and that developing a thorough understanding of issues\nthat current terminal users face is fundamental to knowing how the terminal\nshould evolve. In order to develop that understanding we have mined Unix and\nLinux Stack Exchange using a fully-reproducible method which was able to\nextract and categorize 91.0% of 1,489 terminal-related questions (from the full\nset of nearly 240,000 questions) without manual intervention.\n  We present an analysis, to our knowledge the first of its kind, of windowed\nterminal-related questions posted over a 15-year period and viewed, in\naggregate, approximately 40 million times. As expected, given its longevity, we\nfind the terminal's many features being applied across a wide variety of use\ncases. We find evidence that the terminal, as windowed terminal emulator, has\nneither fully adapted to its now current graphical environment nor completely\nuntangled itself from features more suited to incarnations in previous\nenvironments. We also find evidence of areas where we believe the terminal\ncould be extended along with other areas where it could be simplified.\nSurprisingly, while many current efforts to improve the terminal include\nimproving the terminal's social and collaborative aspects, we find little\nevidence of this as a prominent pain point.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Michael MacInnis</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Olga Baysal</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Michele Lanza</name>\n    </author>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13994v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13994v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.HC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.HC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.OS\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.SE\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01015v1</id>\n    <updated>2021-03-01T14:03:49Z</updated>\n    <published>2021-03-01T14:03:49Z</published>\n    <title>On performance bound estimation in NMPC with time-varying terminal cost</title>\n    <summary>  Model predictive control (MPC) schemes are commonly designed with fixed,\ni.e., time-invariant, horizon length and cost functions. If no stabilizing\nterminal ingredients are used, stability can be guaranteed via a sufficiently\nlong horizon. A suboptimality index can be derived that gives bounds on the\nperformance of the MPC law over an infinite-horizon (IH). While for\ntime-invariant schemes such index can be computed offline, less attention has\nbeen paid to time-varying strategies with adapting cost function which can be\nfound, e.g., in learning-based optimal control. This work addresses the\nperformance bounds of nonlinear MPC with stabilizing horizon and time-varying\nterminal cost. A scheme is proposed that uses the decay of the optimal\nfinite-horizon cost and convolutes a history stack to predict the bounds on the\nIH performance. Based on online information on the decay rate, the performance\nbound estimate is improved while the terminal cost is adapted using methods\nfrom adaptive dynamic programming. The adaptation of the terminal cost leads to\nperformance improvement over a time-invariant scheme with the same horizon\nlength. The approach is demonstrated in a case study.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Lukas Beckenbach</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Stefan Streif</name>\n    </author>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01015v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01015v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"eess.SY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"eess.SY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.SY\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"math.OC\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"49N35\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07651v1</id>\n    <updated>2018-03-20T20:56:25Z</updated>\n    <published>2018-03-20T20:56:25Z</published>\n    <title>Distributed Model Predictive Control for Linear Systems with Adaptive\n  Terminal Sets</title>\n    <summary>  In this paper, we propose a distributed model predictive control (DMPC)\nscheme for linear time-invariant constrained systems which admit a separable\nstructure. To exploit the merits of distributed computation algorithms, the\nstabilizing terminal controller, value function and invariant terminal set of\nthe DMPC optimization problem need to respect the loosely coupled structure of\nthe system. Although existing methods in the literature address this task, they\ntypically decouple the synthesis of terminal controllers and value functions\nfrom the one of terminal sets. In addition, these approaches do not explicitly\nconsider the effect of the current state of the system in the synthesis\nprocess. These limitations can lead the resulting DMPC scheme to poor\nperformance since it may admit small or even empty terminal sets. Unlike other\napproaches, this paper presents a unified framework to encapsulate the\nsynthesis of both the stabilizing terminal controller and invariant terminal\nset into the DMPC formulation. Conditions for Lyapunov stability and invariance\nare imposed in the synthesis problem in a way that allows the value function\nand invariant terminal set to admit the desired distributed structure.

In this case,\nstandard coding techniques are either prohibitively complex to decode, or\nrequire network-source coding separation, resulting in sub-optimal transmission\nrates. To alleviate this problem, we offer a joint network-source coding scheme\nbased on matrix sparsification at the code design phase, which allows the\nterminals to use an efficient decoding procedure (syndrome decoding using\nLDPC), despite the network coding throughout the network. Via a novel relation\nbetween matrix sparsification and rate-distortion theory, we give lower and\nupper bounds on the best achievable sparsification performance. These bounds\nallow us to analyze our scheme, and, in particular, show that in the limit\nwhere all receivers have comparable side information (in terms of conditional\nentropy), or, equivalently, have weak side information, a vanishing density can\nbe achieved. As a result, efficient decoding is possible at all terminals\nsimultaneously.

Both the semantic\ncharacterisation and most known termination methods are concerned with global\ntermination, uniformly of all the terms of a term rewriting system (TRS). In\nthis paper we consider local termination, of specific sets of terms within a\ngiven TRS. The principal goal of this paper is generalising the semantic\ncharacterisation of global termination to local termination. This is made\npossible by admitting the well-founded monotone algebras to be partial. We also\nextend our approach to local relative termination. The interest in local\ntermination naturally arises in program verification, where one is probably\ninterested only in sensible inputs, or just wants to characterise the set of\ninputs for which a program terminates. Local termination will be also be of\ninterest when dealing with a specific class of terms within a TRS that is known\nto be non-terminating, such as combinatory logic (CL) or a TRS encoding\nrecursive program schemes or Turing machines. We show how some of the\nwell-known techniques for proving global termination, such as stepwise removal\nof rewrite rules and semantic labelling, can be adapted to the local case. We\nalso describe transformations reducing local to global termination problems.\nThe resulting techniques for proving local termination have in some cases\nalready been automated. One of our applications concerns the characterisation\nof the terminating S-terms in CL as regular language. Previously this language\nhad already been found via a tedious analysis of the reduction behaviour of\nS-terms. These findings have now been vindicated by a fully automated and\nverified proof.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Joerg Endrullis</name>\n      <arxiv:affiliation xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</arxiv:affiliation>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Roel de Vrijer</name>\n      <arxiv:affiliation xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</arxiv:affiliation>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Johannes Waldmann</name>\n      <arxiv:affiliation xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Hochschule fuer Technik, Wirtschaft und Kultur Leipzig</arxiv:affiliation>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10.2168/LMCS-6(3:20)2010</arxiv:doi>\n    <link title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2168/LMCS-6(3:20)2010\" rel=\"related\"/>\n    <arxiv:journal_ref xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 6, Issue 3 (September\n  7, 2010) lmcs:879</arxiv:journal_ref>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4955v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.4955v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.LO\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.LO\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"D.3.1, F.4.1, F.4.2, I.1.1, I.1.3\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2296v1</id>\n    <updated>2013-10-08T22:19:04Z</updated>\n    <published>2013-10-08T22:19:04Z</published>\n    <title>Interactive Relay Assisted Source Coding</title>\n    <summary>  This paper investigates a source coding problem in which two terminals\ncommunicating through a relay wish to estimate one another's source within some\ndistortion constraint.

Similar to typical MPC\nschemes, a structured Lyapunov matrix and a distributed terminal controller,\nrespecting the distributed structure of the system, are computed offline.\nHowever, in this scheme, a distributed positively invariant terminal set is\ncomputed online and updated at each time instant taking into consideration the\ncurrent state of the system. In particular, we consider ellipsoidal terminal\nsets as they are easy to compute for large-scale systems. The size and the\ncenter of these terminal sets, together with the predicted state and input\ntrajectories, are considered as decision variables in the online phase.\nDetermining the terminal set center online is found to be useful specifically\nin the presence of asymmetric constraints. Finally, a relaxation of the\nresulting online optimal control problem is provided.

In this paper, we study the NK model for fitness landscapes where\nthe interaction scheme between genes can be explicitly defined. The focus is on\nhow this scheme influences the overall shape of the landscape. Our main tool\nfor the analysis are adaptive walks, an idealized dynamics by which the\npopulation moves uphill in fitness and terminates at a local fitness maximum.\nWe use three different types of walks and investigate how their length (the\nnumber of steps required to reach a local peak) and height (the fitness at the\nendpoint of the walk) depend on the dimensionality and structure of the\nlandscape. We find that the distribution of local maxima over the landscape is\nparticularly sensitive to the choice of interaction pattern. Most quantities\nthat we measure are simply correlated to the rank of the scheme, which is equal\nto the number of nonzero coefficients in the expansion of the fitness landscape\nin terms of Walsh functions.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Stefan Nowak</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Joachim Krug</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10.1088/1742-5468/2015/06/P06014</arxiv:doi>\n    <link title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/2015/06/P06014\" rel=\"related\"/>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">29 pages, 9 figures</arxiv:comment>\n    <arxiv:journal_ref xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">J.

The investigation of long GRBs\ntherefore requires modeling the propagation of ultra-relativistic blastwaves\nthrough the circumburst medium surrounding massive stars. We simulate the\nexpansion of an isotropic, adiabatic relativistic fireball into the wind-shaped\nmedium around a massive GRB progenitor. The circumburst medium is composed of a\nrealistically stratified stellar wind zone up to its termination shock,\nfollowed by a region of shocked wind characterized by a constant density. Aims:\nWe followed the evolution of the blastwave through all its stages, including\nthe extremely rapid acceleration up to a Lorentz factor 75 flow, its\ndeceleration by interaction with stellar wind, its passage of the wind\ntermination shock, until its propagation through shocked wind. Methods: We used\nthe adaptive mesh refinement versatile advection code to follow the evolution\nof the fireball. Results: We show that the acceleration from purely thermal to\nultra-relativistic kinetic regimes is abrupt and produces an internally\nstructured blastwave. We resolved the structure of this ultra-relativistic\nshell in all stages, thanks to the adaptive mesh. We comment on the dynamical\nroles played by forward and reverse shock pairs in the phase of interaction\nwith the free stellar wind and clearly identify the complex shock-dominated\nstructure created when the shell crosses the terminal shock. Conclusion: We\nshow that in our model where the terminal shock is taken relatively close to\nthe massive star, the phase of self-similar deceleration of Blandford-McKee\ntype can only be produced in the constant density, shocked wind zone.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Z.

Important performance measures for a coding scheme are its\nmaximum tolerable error rate $\\rho$, communication complexity $N$, and\ncomputational complexity.\n  We give the first coding scheme for the standard setting which performs\noptimally in all three measures: Our randomized non-adaptive coding scheme has\na near-linear computational complexity and tolerates any error rate $\\delta &lt;\n1/4$ with a linear $N = \\Theta(n)$ communication complexity. This improves over\nprior results which each performed well in two of these measures.\n  We also give results for other settings of interest, namely, the first\ncomputationally and communication efficient schemes that tolerate $\\rho &lt;\n\\frac{2}{7}$ adaptively, $\\rho &lt; \\frac{1}{3}$ if only one party is required to\ndecode, and $\\rho &lt; \\frac{1}{2}$ if list decoding is allowed. These are the\noptimal tolerable error rates for the respective settings. These coding schemes\nalso have near linear computational and communication complexity.\n  These results are obtained via two techniques: We give a general black-box\nreduction which reduces unique decoding, in various settings, to list decoding.\nWe also show how to boost the computational and communication efficiency of any\nlist decoder to become near linear.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Mohsen Ghaffari</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Bernhard Haeupler</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">preliminary version</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1763v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.1763v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.DS\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.DS\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"math.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10628v2</id>\n    <updated>2019-01-31T23:26:23Z</updated>\n    <published>2019-01-30T01:04:37Z</published>\n    <title>On Multiterminal Communication over MIMO Channels with One-bit ADCs at\n  the Receivers</title>\n    <summary>  The fundamental limits of communication over multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) networks are considered when a limited number of one-bit analog to\ndigital converters (ADC) are used at the receiver terminals. Prior works have\nmainly focused on point-to-point communications, where receiver architectures\nconsisting of a concatenation of an analog processing module, a limited number\nof one-bit ADCs with non-adaptive thresholds, and a digital processing module\nare considered. In this work, a new receiver architecture is proposed which\nutilizes adaptive threshold one-bit ADCs - where the ADC thresholds at each\nchannel-use are dependent on the channel outputs in the previous channel-uses -\nto mitigate the quantization rate-loss. Coding schemes are proposed for\ncommunication over the point-to-point and broadcast channels, and achievable\nrate regions are derived.

The paper studies the performance of two classes of\nadaptive transmission schemes in a cellular downlink. One class is based on\nphysical layer rateless codes with constant transmit power and the other uses\nfixed-rate codes in conjunction with power adaptation. Using a simple\nstochastic geometry model for the cellular downlink, the focus is to compare\nthe adaptivity of fixed-rate codes with power adaptation to that of physical\nlayer rateless codes only. The performance of both rateless and fixed-rate\ncoded adaptive transmission schemes are compared by evaluating the typical user\nsuccess probability and rate achievable with the two schemes. Based on both the\ntheoretical analysis and simulation results, it is clearly shown that\nfixed-rate codes require power control to maintain good performance whereas\nphysical layer rateless codes with constant power can still provide robust\nperformance.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Amogh Rajanna</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Carl P.

In contrast to other interactive capacity\ndefinitions in the literature, this definition makes no assumptions on the\norder of speakers (which can be adaptive) and does not allow any use of private\n/ public randomness; hence, the essential interactive capacity is a function of\nthe channel model only. It is shown that the essential interactive capacity of\nany binary memoryless symmetric (BMS) channel is at least $0.0302$ its Shannon\ncapacity. To that end, we present a simple coding scheme, based on\nextended-Hamming codes combined with error detection, that achieves the lower\nbound in the special case of the binary symmetric channel (BSC). We then adapt\nthe scheme to the entire family of BMS channels, and show that it achieves the\nsame lower bound using extremes of the Bhattacharyya parameter.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Assaf Ben-Yishai</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Young-Han Kim</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Or Ordentlich</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Ofer Shayevitz</name>\n    </author>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07367v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07367v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"math.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0277v2</id>\n    <updated>2015-01-08T16:19:29Z</updated>\n    <published>2014-10-01T16:30:21Z</published>\n    <title>Terminated and Tailbiting Spatially-Coupled Codes with Optimized Bit\n  Mappings for Spectrally Efficient Fiber-Optical Systems</title>\n    <summary>  We study the design of spectrally efficient fiber-optical communication\nsystems based on different spatially coupled (SC) forward error correction\n(FEC) schemes. In particular, we optimize the allocation of the coded bits from\nthe FEC encoder to the modulation bits of the signal constellation. Two SC code\nclasses are considered. The codes in the first class are protograph-based\nlow-density parity-check (LDPC) codes which are decoded using iterative\nsoft-decision decoding. The codes in the second class are generalized LDPC\ncodes which are decoded using iterative hard-decision decoding. For both code\nclasses, the bit allocation is optimized for the terminated and tailbiting SC\ncases based on a density evolution analysis. An optimized bit allocation can\nsignificantly improve the performance of tailbiting SC codes codes over the\nbaseline sequential allocation, up to the point where they have a comparable\ngap to capacity as their terminated counterparts, at a lower FEC overhead. For\nthe considered terminated SC codes, the optimization only results in marginal\nperformance improvements, suggesting that in this case a sequential allocation\nis close to optimal.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Christian H\u00e4ger</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Alexandre Graell i Amat</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Fredrik Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Alex Alvarado</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Erik Agrell</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10.1109/JLT.2015.2390596</arxiv:doi>\n    <link title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2390596\" rel=\"related\"/>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">This paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE/OSA Journal\n  of Lightwave Technology</arxiv:comment>\n    <arxiv:journal_ref xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">IEEE/OSA Journal of Lightwave Technology, vol. 33, no. 7, pp.\n  1275-1285 Apr. 2015 [invited]</arxiv:journal_ref>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0277v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.0277v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"math.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"physics.optics\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03726v1</id>\n    <updated>2017-02-13T11:48:16Z</updated>\n    <published>2017-02-13T11:48:16Z</published>\n    <title>On Muting Mobile Terminals for Uplink Interference Mitigation in HetNets\n  -- System-Level Analysis via Stochastic Geometry</title>\n    <summary>  We investigate the performance of a scheduling algorithm where the Mobile\nTerminals (MTs) may be turned off if they cause a level of interference greater\nthan a given threshold. This approach, which is referred to as Interference\nAware Muting (IAM), may be regarded as an interference-aware scheme that is\naimed to reduce the level of interference. We analyze its performance with the\naid of stochastic geometry and compare it against other interference-unaware\nand interference-aware schemes, where the level of interference is kept under\ncontrol in the power control scheme itself rather than in the scheduling\nprocess. IAM is studied in terms of average transmit power, mean and variance\nof the interference, coverage probability, Spectral Efficiency (SE), and Binary\nRate (BR), which accounts for the amount of resources allocated to the typical\nMT. Simplified expressions of SE and BR for adaptive modulation and coding\nschemes are proposed, which better characterize practical communication\nsystems. Our system-level analysis unveils that IAM increases the BR and\nreduces the mean and variance of the interference. It is proved that an\noperating regime exists, where the performance of IAM is independent of the\ncell association criterion, which simplifies the joint design of uplink and\ndownlink transmissions.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>F.

Slotted ALOHA and its derivatives\nrepresent a simple solution for distributed random access in wireless networks.\nRecently, a framed version of slotted ALOHA gained renewed interest due to the\nincorporation of successive interference cancellation (SIC) in the scheme,\nwhich resulted in substantially higher throughputs. Based on similar principles\nand inspired by the rateless coding paradigm, a frameless approach for\ndistributed random access in slotted ALOHA framework is described in this\npaper. The proposed approach shares an operational analogy with rateless\ncoding, expressed both through the user access strategy and the adaptive length\nof the contention period, with the objective to end the contention when the\ninstantaneous throughput is maximized. The paper presents the related analysis,\nproviding heuristic criteria for terminating the contention period and showing\nthat very high throughputs can be achieved, even for a low number for\ncontending users. The demonstrated results potentially have more direct\npractical implications compared to the approaches for coded random access that\nlead to high throughputs only asymptotically.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Cedomir Stefanovic</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Petar Popovski</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Revised version submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1503v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.1503v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"math.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06709v4</id>\n    <updated>2020-06-29T13:32:55Z</updated>\n    <published>2019-09-15T01:49:40Z</published>\n    <title>Low-Latency Network-Adaptive Error Control for Interactive Streaming</title>\n    <summary>  We introduce a novel network-adaptive algorithm that is suitable for\nalleviating network packet losses for low-latency interactive communications\nbetween a source and a destination. Our network-adaptive algorithm estimates in\nreal-time the best parameters of a recently proposed streaming code that uses\nforward error correction (FEC) to correct both arbitrary and burst losses,\nwhich cause a crackling noise and undesirable jitters, respectively in audio.\nIn particular, the destination estimates appropriate coding parameters based on\nits observed packet loss pattern and sends them back to the source for updating\nthe underlying code. Besides, a new explicit construction of practical\nlow-latency streaming codes that achieve the optimal tradeoff between the\ncapability of correcting arbitrary losses and the capability of correcting\nburst losses is provided. Simulation evaluations based on statistical losses\nand real-world packet loss traces reveal the following: (i) Our proposed\nnetwork-adaptive algorithm combined with our optimal streaming codes can\nachieve significantly higher performance compared to uncoded and non-adaptive\nFEC schemes over UDP (User Datagram Protocol); (ii) Our explicit streaming\ncodes can significantly outperform traditional MDS (maximum-distance separable)\nstreaming schemes when they are used along with our network-adaptive algorithm.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Salma Emara</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Silas L.

The\nproposed PNC approach is applied for uplink scenario in binary systems, and the\ndesign guideline serves multiple mobile terminals (MTs) and guarantees\nunambiguous recovery of the message from each MT. We present a novel PNC design\ncriterion first based on binary matrix theories, followed by an adaptive\noptimal mapping selection algorithm based on the proposed design criterion. In\norder to reduce the real-time computational complexity, a two-stage search\nalgorithm for the optimal binary PNC mapping matrix is developed. Numerical\nresults show that the proposed scheme achieves lower outage probability with\nreduced backhaul load compared to practical CoMP schemes which quantize the\nestimated symbols from a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) based multiuser detector\ninto binary bits at each access point (AP).\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Tong Peng</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Yi Wang</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Alister G.

Based on the multicasting opportunities provided by the so-called\nCoded Caching technique, we investigate three delivery approaches. Our baseline\nscheme employs the coded caching technique on top of max-min fair multicasting.\nThe second one consists of a joint design of Zero-Forcing (ZF) and coded\ncaching, where the coded chunks are formed in the signal domain (complex\nfield). The third scheme is similar to the second one with the difference that\nthe coded chunks are formed in the data domain (finite field). We derive\nclosed-form rate expressions where our results suggest that the latter two\nschemes surpass the first one in terms of Degrees of Freedom (DoF). However, at\nthe intermediate SNR regime forming coded chunks in the signal domain results\nin power loss, and will deteriorate throughput of the second scheme. The main\nmessage of our paper is that the schemes performing well in terms of DoF may\nnot be directly appropriate for intermediate SNR regimes, and modified schemes\nshould be employed.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Seyed Pooya Shariatpanahi</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Giuseppe Caire</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Babak Hossein Khalaj</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">7 pages, 2 figures</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02979v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02979v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.NI\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"math.IT\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n</feed>\n"}
