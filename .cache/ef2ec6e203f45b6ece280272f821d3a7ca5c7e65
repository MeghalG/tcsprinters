Specifically, the $h$-index of a user is the largest integer $h$\nsuch that at least $h$ publications of the user have at least $h$ units of\npositive feedback.\n  We design an algorithm that, given query access to the $n$ publications of a\nuser and each publication's corresponding positive feedback number, outputs a\n$(1\\pm \\varepsilon)$-approximation of the $h$-index of this user with\nprobability at least $1-\\delta$ in time \\[\n  O(\\frac{n \\cdot \\ln{(1/\\delta)}}{\\varepsilon^2 \\cdot h}),\n  \\] where $h$ is the actual $h$-index which is unknown to the algorithm\na-priori. We then design a novel lower bound technique that allows us to prove\nthat this bound is in fact asymptotically optimal for this problem in all\nparameters $n,h,\\varepsilon,$ and $\\delta$.\n  Our work is one of the first in sublinear time algorithms that addresses\nobtaining asymptotically optimal bounds, especially in terms of the error and\nconfidence parameters. As such, we focus on designing novel techniques for this\ntask. In particular, our lower bound technique seems quite general -- to\nshowcase this, we also use our approach to prove an asymptotically optimal\nlower bound for the problem of estimating the number of triangles in a graph in\nsublinear time, which now is also optimal in the error and confidence\nparameters. This result improves upon prior lower bounds of Eden, Levi, Ron,\nand Seshadhri (FOCS'15) for this problem, as well as multiple follow-ups that\nextended this lower bound to other subgraph counting problems.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Sepehr Assadi</name>\n    </author>\n    <author>\n      <name>Hoai-An Nguyen</name>\n    </author>\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Full version of the paper accepted to APPROX 2022</arxiv:comment>\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08114v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08114v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.DS\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n    <category term=\"cs.DS\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\n  </entry>\n</feed>\n"}
