This improves over an $O(\\log n)$-space $4/9\n&lt; 0.45$ approximation algorithm due to Chou, Golovnev, and Velusamy (FOCS\n2020), which was known to be optimal for $o(\\sqrt{n})$-space algorithms.\nMax-DICUT is a special case of a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). In this\nbroader context, we give the first CSP for which algorithms with\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ space can provably outperform $o(\\sqrt{n})$-space\nalgorithms.\n  The key technical contribution of our work is development of the notions of a\nfirst-order snapshot of a (directed) graph and of estimates of such snapshots.\nThese snapshots can be used to simulate certain (non-streaming) Max-DICUT\nalgorithms, including the \"oblivious\" algorithms introduced by Feige and Jozeph\n(Algorithmica, 2015), who showed that one such algorithm achieves a\n0.483-approximation.\n  Previous work of the authors (SODA 2023) studied the restricted case of\nbounded-degree graphs, and observed that in this setting, it is straightforward\nto estimate the snapshot with $\\ell_1$ errors and this suffices to simulate\noblivious algorithms. But for unbounded-degree graphs, even defining an\nachievable and sufficient notion of estimation is subtle. We describe a new\nnotion of snapshot estimation and prove its sufficiency using careful smoothing\ntechniques, and then develop an algorithm which sketches such an estimate via a\ndelicate process of intertwined vertex- and edge-subsampling.\n  Prior to our work, the only streaming algorithms for any CSP on general\ninstances were based on generalizations of the $O(\\log n)$-space algorithm for\nMax-DICUT, and thus our work opens the possibility of a new class of algorithms\nfor approximating CSPs.\n</summary>\n    <author>\n      <name>Raghuvansh R.
